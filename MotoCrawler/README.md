"Moto Crawler" is a project that allows user to store searches of his/her favourite cars.

It is being developed solely by me - Pawel Sarapata, young back-end codemonkey wannabe from Poland.
I am developing it for my personal purposes ONLY, therefore be advised NOT to use its' code commercially as that would have legal consequences.

Moto Crawler is being built using Python 3, supported by Django, Scrapy and Celery frameworks/utilities.
Databases are managed using PostgreSQL and psycopg2 library for Python.

I will try to continuously update this README file as I progress with this project.
