This project is a Coders LabÂ© workshop. It's purpose is to make a reservation for a Conference Room, for the given day.
Assumptions:

Homepage:
* 1 reservation / day (for project simplicity)
* home page lists all conference rooms (with links to their detail view) with their status for the day.


Details view:
* after clicking on a room, you will see it's name, capacity and addition info (whether it's fitted with a projector)
* There are also options to make a reservation, delete or create a room (? - sorry, that was one of the tasks! :D) or modify it

Edit view:
* User can add room info: name, capacity, projector availability

Reservation view:
* Shows room availability.
