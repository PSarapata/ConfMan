After giving it more thought I decided to make it look more professional and create additional Repositories for each project I work on,
instead of making one big "rubbish bin" to dump all the code in there. Of course the code in my public repos is just a pinch of what I've created.
If you would like to see more, don't hesitate to ask!


Here you can find an overview of this particular project (The styling I forgot before uploading the video is added already, project is fully functional):
